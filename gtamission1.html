					<h3><b>Mission Desciption </b> <br><br> </h3>
					<p>
						In the "Franklin and Lamar" mission in GTA V, after the
						prologue
						and Michael's credit scene,
						Franklin and Lamar are tasked with repossessing two cars for Simeon Yetarian. The mission
						involves a high-speed chase through the streets of Los Santos as the characters pursue the
						debtors and attempt to retrieve the vehicles. The mission serves as an introduction to the
						driving mechanics of the game and the open-world environment. Players must navigate through
						traffic, evade the police, and work together with Lamar to successfully complete the repo job
						and deliver the cars to Simeon's dealership. This mission sets the tone for the game's
						action-packed sequences and showcases the dynamic and immersive gameplay of Grand Theft Auto V.
					</p>

					<h3><b> Why this testing ? </b><br><br></h3>
					<p>
						"I have chosen to focus on testing the Franklin and Lamar mission from Grand Theft Auto V as
						part of my application for the Rockstar testing team for several reasons. Firstly, this specific
						mission serves as an excellent benchmark for assessing various aspects of game functionality.
						Its dynamic and interactive nature allows for a comprehensive evaluation of in-game mechanics,
						AI behavior, and mission-specific features.By meticulously testing the Franklin and Lamar
						mission, I
						aim to showcase my ability to identify
						and document potential issues, ranging from minor glitches to more critical bugs that may impact
						the overall player experience. This mission, being one of the early and crucial sequences in
						Grand Theft Auto V, provides an opportunity to evaluate the game's foundational elements and
						ensures that the core gameplay experience is polished and enjoyable. </br> </br>

						Moreover, choosing this mission aligns with my aspiration to be a valuable member of the
						Rockstar testing team. It reflects my commitment to understanding the intricacies of the game,
						my attention to detail, and my dedication to contributing to the development of high-quality
						gaming experiences. I believe that a meticulous examination of the Franklin and Lamar mission
						will not only demonstrate my testing skills but also illustrate my enthusiasm for being a part
						of the team responsible for ensuring the excellence of Rockstar Games. </br> </br>
						In essence, this test plan allows me to exhibit my passion for gaming, my proficiency in
						identifying potential issues, and my eagerness to contribute to the ongoing success of Rockstar
						Games. I am confident that by thoroughly testing this mission, I can provide valuable insights
						that contribute to the overall quality and enjoyment of Grand Theft Auto V and showcase my
						suitability for a role within the Rockstar testing team." <br> <br> <br></p>



					<h3><b>Testing Methodology</b> <br>
						<p>
					</h3>


					I approached testing the Franklin and Lamar mission in Grand Theft Auto V with a systematic and
					thorough methodology to identify and document potential issues. My aim was to ensure a smooth
					and immersive player experience while covering various aspects of gameplay. <br><br>

					<b>1. Environment Setup:</b><br>

					a. Platform Selection: I conducted tests on 2 different PC (Laptops), to ensure
					hardware-specific issues were identified. <br>
					b. Game Version: Verified that the game was the latest version with all updates installed to
					account for any patches or fixes that might impact the mission. <br><br>

					<b>2. Pre-Testing Analysis</b><br>

					a. Mission Familiarization: Played through the mission to understand the objectives, characters,
					and expected outcomes.<br>
					b. Documentation: Developed a checklist of mission-specific elements, including scripted events,
					character interactions, and environmental details to guide the testing process. <br><br>

					<b>3. Testing Execution</b><br>

					a. Scenario Testing: Explored different approaches to the mission, testing various choices,
					routes,
					and strategies to uncover potential branching issues.<br>
					b. Reproducibility: Ensured that identified issues were consistently reproducible by following
					specific steps, allowing for easier debugging.
					c. Time Management: Tracked the time spent on testing each aspect of the mission, optimizing for
					efficiency while maintaining a comprehensive examination. <br><br>

					<b>4. Tools and Techniques</b><br>

					a. In-Game Tools: Utilized in-game tools and features, such as the mission replay system, to
					revisit specific sections and thoroughly investigate reported issues.<br>
					b. External Tools: Employed external tools for performance monitoring, identifying potential
					resource utilization problems or bottlenecks that could affect gameplay. <br><br>

					<b>5. Exploratory Testing</b><br>

					a. Environmental Exploration: Investigated the game world beyond mission objectives to identify
					any
					environmental anomalies or issues.<br>
					b. AI Interaction: Interacted with non-playable characters (NPCs) to assess AI behavior and
					responsiveness, ensuring a realistic and engaging experience. <br><br>


					<h3><b>Tools Used</b></h3><br>
					<p>
						<b>Performance Testing Tools</b> <br>
						I used Asus Armoury Crate app for performance monitoring. Monitored different aspects related to
						performance.<br>
					</p> <br>

					<p><i>Complete video of the mission's performance monitoring is down below. Please check it.</i></p> <br>

					<h3><b>Challenges Faced</b></h3> 
					<p>
						<b> Performance Bottlenecks</b> When i played the mission, sometimes i feel screen lagging and
						fps dropping. <br> <br>


					</p>


					<h3><b>Lessons Learned from the Testing Experience</b></h3> <br>
					<p>
						<b>Thoroughness is Key:</b>

						Comprehensive testing involves exploring various aspects of the game, not just the critical
						path. Testing different scenarios helps uncover potential issues that might be overlooked. <br>
						<b>Variety in Testing Strategies:</b>
						Testing from different perspectives and trying various approaches to playing the mission helps
						identify a broader range of issues. This includes testing different character actions, choices,
						and environmental interactions. <br>
						<b>Platform Diversity:</b>
						Testing on different platforms is essential to ensure a consistent and enjoyable experience for
						players on various devices. Pay attention to platform-specific issues and report them
						accordingly. <br>
						<b>Adaptability:</b>
						esting different scenarios in the mission enhances your adaptability to changing circumstances,
						a valuable trait in the dynamic field of game development.<br>
						<b>Attention to Detail:</b>
						Testing requires a meticulous eye for detail. The process of identifying and documenting issues
						improves your attention to detail, a skill highly valued in quality assurance roles.<br>
						<b>Problem-Solving Skills:</b>
						Encountering and addressing unexpected issues enhances your problem-solving skills. This is
						critical for a tester to provide not only the problem but potential insights into its root
						cause.<br>
						<b>Time Management:</b>
						Balancing thorough testing with time constraints teaches valuable time management skills.
						Prioritizing tasks and focusing on high-impact areas during testing is crucial in a professional
						setting.
					</p> <br>

					<h3><b>Results</b></h3> <br>
					<p>
						I successfully completed comprehensive testing of the Franklin and Lamar mission in Grand Theft
						Auto V, meticulously exploring various scenarios and aspects of the mission. Throughout this
						testing process, I am pleased to report that no bugs or issues were identified. The mission
						executed smoothly, and all game elements performed as expected.
